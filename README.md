# On Creating a More Inclusive and Supporting Community

Inspired by the panel on allyship and inclusion at CRYPTO ’22, we present a call to action and some suggestions for improving the state of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) community from various perspectives. The objective of this document is to draw
attention to some issues, especially those of DEI-kind (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion), along with proposed pathways to solutions that are informed by the authors’ lived experiences. We hope that this document will contribute to the ongoing discourse on DEI in the IACR community, and that
our proposals might spark concrete action towards creating a more equitable and diverse research environment.

We do not expect the IACR to act on all ideas, as not all fit it within its role; but we hope that this document serves as an inspiration and incentive to IACR members and individuals to offer help and take actions to improve the current state of affairs.
